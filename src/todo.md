# TODO

In order to not litter the actual code with a ton of TODO's and the relevant information 
since there are quite a few at this point I'd like to keep somewhat of an orderly list of
things I'd like to port over from the vs-code extension to here.

[ ] Code lens related things
[ ] Doctor related stuff
[ ] Ability to have input box enabled
[ ] Get progress items working correctly
