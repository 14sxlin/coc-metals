# TODO

In order to not litter the actual code with a ton of TODO's and the relevant information
 since there are quite a few at this point I'd like to keep somewhat of an orderly list of
things I'd like to port over from the vs-code extension to here.

- [ ] Code lens related things
  - It looks like the languages interface from vscode isn't implimented
- [ ] Check if there is a possibility to run doctor in vim
- [ ] Ability to have input box enabled
- [ ] Get status bar items to work correctly ( Note: this should be done way later since we can't guarantee a user has a statusline integration)
- [ ] enableScaladocIndentation()
  - since there doesn't seem to be the ability to use setLangugageConfiguration
- [ ] figure out of there is a way to reveal active file possibly using nerdtree
- [ ] since we don't have views like in vscode, figure out how to for example give options for a help panel
- [ ] OnNotification MetalsStatus is not implemented
